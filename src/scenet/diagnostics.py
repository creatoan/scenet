"""Machine-readable diagnostics, in SARIF.

A compiler failure is prose on stderr. That is right for a person and useless for
anything else: CI cannot annotate a pull request with it, an editor cannot draw a
squiggle under it, and an agent repairing its own output cannot tell which of five
things went wrong.

**This matters more here than the published JSON Schema does.** The checks that catch
what a generator actually gets wrong are `model_validator`s in
:mod:`scenet.ir <scenet.ir>` -- every actor id resolving to a cast member, the
`left_of`/`right_of` graph being acyclic -- and neither is expressible in JSON Schema at
all. Structured diagnostics are what make a generate/validate/repair loop work, whether
the thing doing the repairing is a person pasting an error back into a chat window or a
tool call.

## Why SARIF

[SARIF 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) is an
OASIS standard. GCC emits it under `-fdiagnostics-format=sarif`, MSVC and Clang emit it,
and GitHub code scanning ingests it directly. A bespoke `{"errors": [...]}` shape would
be one nobody else can read.

**2.1.0, not 2.2.** 2.2 is still a draft, and 2.1.0 documents are forward-consumable by
2.2 processors, so there is nothing to gain by chasing it.

**Hand-built, not `sarif-python-om`.** The document is one run, one driver and a handful
of results; the object model would be a runtime dependency and a licence-gate entry to
build a few nested dicts. `cli.py` already assembles JSON Schema by hand for the same
reason. If the emitted subset grows past a page of code, revisit it.

## Determinism

Byte-identical output for identical input is a project non-negotiable, and it reaches
this module: results come back in source order, rules are emitted sorted by id, and
`partialFingerprints` are content-derived rather than positional -- so a finding keeps
its identity when a comment is added above it, and an alert is not re-raised as new on
every unrelated edit.
