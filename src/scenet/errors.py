"""Every exception Scenet raises, in one place.

A library that scatters its exception types across the modules that happen to raise
them forces callers to import from six places to write one `except` clause. Everything
Scenet can raise is defined here instead, under a single root, so that

    except ScenetError:

catches all of it and nothing else.

The hierarchy is three deep and the middle tier answers the question a caller actually
has, which is *whose fault is it*:

    ScenetError
    |-- SourceError    the document is wrong -- report it to whoever wrote the panel
    |-- SolverError    the document is fine, but no layout satisfies it
    `-- AssetError     a puppet is missing or malformed

Each also inherits the built-in exception a caller would have reached for before this
module existed -- `SourceError` is a `ValueError`, `UnknownPuppetError` is a `KeyError`
-- so pre-existing `except ValueError` handlers keep working unchanged.

    a validator raises into its own `ValidationError`, and for a model-level validator
    it records the location as `()` -- the whole document -- because a validator has no
    way to say which field it was unhappy about. That is accurate and useless: the two
    checks that matter most here, `check_references_resolve` and
    `check_ordering_is_consistent`, both knew the exact path and had nowhere to put it,
    so every such diagnostic read `at <root>`.

    pydantic keeps the exception object it caught, under `ctx["error"]`, so a subclass
    carrying extra attributes survives validation intact and can be recovered on the
    other side. That is the whole trick.

    A plain `ValueError` so that a validator raising one behaves exactly as before for
    anybody not looking for the extra attributes. It deliberately does *not* inherit
    `ScenetError`: it never escapes validation as itself -- pydantic catches it and
