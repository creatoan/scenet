"""Sparse override between panels.

Borrowed from OpenUSD's composition arcs, and specifically from `over`: a panel names
a parent and states only what differs from it.

This matters more for comics than it might look. Consecutive panels in a scene are
mostly identical -- the same cast, the same staging, the same camera -- with one thing
changed. Restating all of it per panel is both tedious and a place for inconsistencies
to creep in, which is exactly the continuity error comics readers notice.

    panels:
      p1:
        camera: {shot: medium_shot}
        cast:
          alice: {reference: alice, at: left_third}
      p2:
        over: p1                      # everything from p1...
        camera: {shot: close_up}      # ...except the framing
