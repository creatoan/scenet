"""The JSON Schema for Scenet documents, as people write them.

The pydantic models in :mod:`scenet.ir <scenet.ir>` are the language's real definition,
and `PanelIR.model_json_schema()` describes them faithfully. **It does not describe what
anybody types.** The YAML frontend accepts conveniences that
:func:`normalise <scenet.frontends.common.normalise>` and
:func:`merge <scenet.compose.merge>` remove before the models see the document:

- staging written as a sentence, `alice left_of bob`;
- script entries tagged by verb, `- say: {by: alice, text: ...}`;
- a setting that names a `place` instead of listing masses;
- in a scene, panels that state only what differs from what they inherit.

Publishing the IR's schema made an editor flag every one of those as an error -- 21 of
the 22 gallery documents, on lines that compiled. So the published schema starts from
the IR's and puts each convenience back, next to a note of the code it mirrors. Every
field, enum and docstring still comes from the models; only the shape changes.

Example:
    >>> from scenet.schema import panel_schema
    >>> schema = panel_schema()
    >>> sorted(schema["properties"]["script"]["items"]["anyOf"][0]["properties"])
    ['say']
