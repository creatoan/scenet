"""Text measurement and line breaking.

Nothing downstream can proceed without this. A balloon's size is a function of its
text, wrapped at some measure, in a specific font -- and placement, occlusion and
reading order all depend on that size. So wrapping is decided here, during
compilation, and the result is carried through Panel Core as explicit lines. The
emitter never re-measures and therefore can never disagree with the solver.

Determinism demands the font be fixed. It arrives as a declared dependency rather
than a system lookup precisely because "whatever font this machine happens to have"
is the opposite of reproducible.
