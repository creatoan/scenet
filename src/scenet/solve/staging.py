"""Horizontal placement, vertical grounding and draw order.

This is where Cassowary earns its place. The arithmetic is trivial -- centring a
figure on a third is one division -- but the *conflicts* are not. Two actors both
asked to stand centre must be pushed apart; a crowded panel must let figures bleed off
the edge rather than overlap. Expressed as priorities, that resolves itself. Written
by hand it becomes an ever-growing cascade of special cases.

Priorities used:

  required  actors never overlap, and keep their declared left-to-right order
  strong    actors stay inside the panel
  weak      actors sit on their requested anchor

Bounds are deliberately *strong* rather than required. Letting a figure bleed past the
panel edge is ordinary comics practice, and far better than refusing to compile a
crowded panel.
