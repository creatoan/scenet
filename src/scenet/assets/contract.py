"""What a character puppet must declare.

The solver never sees artwork -- only this contract. That is what keeps rendering
swappable: the same panel lays out identically whether it is drawn as wireframe
boxes, as vector puppets, or eventually as real artwork.

A character is a skeleton plus parametric limbs rather than a picture, so a pose is
a set of joint angles and not a drawing. That avoids the combinatorial explosion of
one image per pose per expression per facing direction.
