    The approach is borrowed from Vega-Lite, which compiles a high-level grammar into a

class PageCore(CoreModel):
    r"""A fully resolved page: where every panel's frame is.

    The page tier of the same idea as :class:`PanelCore <scenet.core.PanelCore>`. It holds
    the frames and nothing drawn: each panel's contents are its own Panel Core, compiled
    at its frame's size, so a page adds no layout decision to a panel and a panel's Core
    reads the same whether or not it is on a page.

    Attributes:
        format_version: Bumped when the shape of this document changes incompatibly.
        width: Page width, in page units.
        height: Page height.
        lettering_height: The height every panel on the page took its type size from, in
            place of its own -- so that a short panel and a tall one letter alike.
        frames: One per panel, in reading order: tier by tier, left to right.

    Example:
        >>> from scenet import compile_book
        >>> book = compile_book(
        ...     "cast: {a: {reference: alice}}\n"
        ...     "pages: [{tiers: [{panels: [one]}]}]\npanels: {one: {}}"
