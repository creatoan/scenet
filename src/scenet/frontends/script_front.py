"""A frontend for comic script, the format writers already use.

Checked before building this: Fountain has no native panel, caption or SFX support,
and there is no standardised comic script format at all. But the informal industry
convention is stable across publishers -- `PANEL 1`, a prose description, a character
cue in capitals, the dialogue beneath it -- so that is what this parses.

**The honest limitation.** A prose description like "Alice and Bob face each other on
a rainy street corner" cannot be compiled. Turning that into staging needs natural
language understanding, and guessing would produce panels that are confidently wrong
-- far worse than refusing. So descriptions are preserved but not interpreted, and
anything the compiler must know is declared explicitly: cast and staging in a
front-matter block, per-panel settings as `@` directives.

    ---
    cast:
      ALICE: {reference: alice, at: left_third}
      BOB:   {reference: bob,   at: right_third}
    staging:
      - ALICE left_of BOB
    ---

    PANEL 1
    @shot: full_shot
    CAPTION: Midnight. The docks.
    Alice and Bob face each other on a rainy street corner.

    ALICE
    You forgot your umbrella!

    BOB (whisper)
    I know.
