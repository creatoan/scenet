"""Where in the source a value came from.

`yaml.safe_load` returns values and throws away everything about where they were
written, which is fine for compiling and useless for reporting. `yaml.compose` parses
the same text into a *node* tree instead, and every node carries `start_mark` and
`end_mark`. So the document is composed a second time, purely to answer "where is
`script.0.say.by`?".

**`ruamel.yaml` is the library usually reached for here**, and its `.lc` line/column
marks would do the same job. It was not used: PyYAML is already a dependency and this
needs one function, so adding a second YAML implementation to the runtime -- and to the
licence gate -- would buy nothing.

Marks are 0-based; SARIF is 1-based. The conversion happens once, here, at the boundary.
