"""Render every place at every time of day onto one page, and every weather onto another.

Whether three greys read as depth is not a question a test can answer. It is a question
about a picture, and the only way to settle it is to look -- so this puts every place
the library has on one sheet, at every hour, and you look at it.

That makes it the instrument for the decisions the code cannot make on its own: the two
endpoints of the value ladder at each time of day, how far the plane scales separate the
bands, and whether a night panel is still legible once the ladder has been compressed
into the dark end.

    uv run python scripts/setting_sheet.py -o out/setting.svg

Written as the sibling of `scripts/contact_sheet.py`, which did the same job for faces.
Each cell is a real panel drawn small, **not** a small panel: the mass profiles are
composed against panel proportions, so a genuinely small panel would answer a different
question from the one being asked.
