r"""Extract one version's section from CHANGELOG.md.

The release workflow uses this to turn the changelog into release notes, and to check
before publishing anything that the section exists at all.

This was inline `awk` in the workflow first. It silently produced nothing, because a
dynamically built `\\[` in an awk regex is treated as a plain `[`, which opens a character
class. The failure was invisible: the release would have been created with empty notes.
A script can be tested; a line of awk buried in YAML cannot.
