"""Render every expression, or every mark, at every shot type onto one page.

Whether a furrowed brow reads as anger at fourteen panel units is not a question a
test can answer. It is a question about a picture, and the only way to settle it is to
look -- so this puts every face the library can draw on one sheet, at every framing,
and you look at it.

That makes it the instrument for two decisions the code cannot make on its own: the
level-of-detail threshold in `assets/face.py`, below which features stop being a face
and become a smudge, and the per-state offsets that decide whether `sad` and `bored`
are actually distinguishable.

With `--marks` it draws emanata instead, one row per mark, which is the instrument for
`MIN_EMANATA_DETAIL` in `assets/emanata.py` -- the head size below which a plewd stops
being a drop and becomes a dot.

    uv run python scripts/contact_sheet.py -o out/faces.svg
    uv run python scripts/contact_sheet.py --marks -o out/marks.svg

Each cell is a real 1000-unit panel drawn small, **not** a small panel: the threshold
is measured in panel units, so a genuinely small panel would answer a different
question from the one being asked.
