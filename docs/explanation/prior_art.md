# Prior art

What already exists, what was taken from it, and — equally important — what was examined and
deliberately not used. Recorded so later contributors need not repeat the search, and so design
decisions can be argued with rather than guessed at.

Three verdicts: **load-bearing** (it changed the code), **future** (real, but not yet),
**not reusable** (examined and rejected, with the reason).

## Load-bearing

### Comic Chat — Kurlander, Skelly & Salesin, SIGGRAPH '96

[Paper](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/comics.pdf) ·
[source, MIT, released July 2026](https://github.com/microsoft/comic-chat)

The canonical solution to this exact problem, and largely forgotten. Comic Chat rendered live IRC
conversations as comic strips, automatically choosing which characters appeared in each panel, where
they stood, which way they faced, the camera zoom, the balloon shapes, and — critically — balloon
placement obeying reading order.

Taken: the overall decomposition, the insight that reading order is a hard constraint rather than a
preference, the practice of opening a sequence with a wider establishing shot, and — added later —
**the expression vocabulary**. Comic Chat's emotion wheel carried `laughing`, `happy`, `coy`,
`bored`, `scared`, `sad`, `angry` and `shouting`, with `neutral` at its centre. Scenet ships those
nine plus `surprise`.

That set was preferred to Ekman's six deliberately. It comes from a system that actually rendered
faces for live conversations rather than from a psychology of emotion, and it shows: `coy` and
`bored` are cartoonists' categories, and no taxonomy of felt emotion would produce them. Which is
exactly the framing the literature demands — see Barrett below.

**Nothing is vendored** — not code, not artwork. See
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES](https://github.com/creatoan/scenet/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for why.

### WordsEye — Coyne & Sproat, SIGGRAPH 2001

[Paper](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~coyne/papers/wordseye_siggraph.pdf)

Automatic text-to-scene conversion, and the direct ancestor of the whole idea. WordsEye turned
English into a 3D scene in stages: the text is tagged and parsed into a dependency structure, that
structure is interpreted into a *semantic representation* of entities and the relations between
them, and only then do depiction rules turn it into low-level *depictors* — object placement, pose,
spatial relation, colour. Its object library carried more than geometry: skeletons for posing
characters, shape displacements for faces ("smiling, eyes closed, frowning"), and *spatial tags*
marking the regions of an object a relation can use, such as the top surface of a table or the
inside of a bowl.

Taken: the shape of the pipeline, and the principle that a depictable object must declare where
relations attach to it. Scenet's IR is a semantic representation in WordsEye's sense and Panel
Core is its set of depictors; a puppet's poses, expressions and named anchors are the same three
kinds of asset metadata as skeletons, shape displacements and spatial tags.

Not taken: the front end. WordsEye's hard problem was natural language — parsing, word sense,
coreference — and its authors said plainly what that costs: "since linguistic descriptions tend to
be at a high level of abstraction, there will be a certain amount of unpredictability in the
graphical result." Scenet starts one stage later, at the semantic representation, and never
interprets prose. With a language model in the loop that division of labour is cleaner than it
was in 2001: the model does the step WordsEye found hardest, language to semantics, and the
compiler does the step that ought to be deterministic. That is the whole argument for the
[agent-facing surface](../howto/drive_from_a_model.md).

### Vega-Lite

[Paper](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2017-VegaLite-InfoVis.pdf) ·
[site](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)

The closest structural precedent that exists: a declarative high-level grammar compiling to a
*lower-level grammar*, which then emits SVG — with the compiler deriving components (scales, axes,
legends) by rule rather than making the author specify them.

Taken: the two-tier pipeline. Source compiles to [Panel Core](../reference/panel_core.md), which is
then emitted. Scenet's automatically derived components are figure scale, balloon geometry and tail
routing. Leland Wilkinson's *Grammar of Graphics* is the ancestor idea; Vega-Lite is the proof it
survives contact with a real implementation.

### Semantic scene graphs — Visual Genome

[Visual Genome](https://visualgenome.org/)

Modelling an image as nodes (objects with attributes) and directed edges (relations) is the standard
machine-readable representation of image *content* rather than image *pixels*.

Taken: this is the IR. The [`staging`](../reference/language.md#staging) block is literally a set of
relation triples, and its predicate vocabulary is anchored on Visual Genome's spatial subset rather
than invented, so scenes stay convertible in both directions.

### OpenUSD composition arcs

[OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/intro.html)

Pixar's scene description format solves a problem comics share: describing many related scenes that
mostly repeat, without duplicating them.

Taken as *semantics*, not as a dependency — three arcs by name. `reference` (a panel pulls a
character from a library), `variantSet` (switchable alternatives; poses now, style later), and
`over`, sparse override, where a panel names a parent and changes only what differs. That last one
matters enormously for comics, where consecutive panels in a scene share nearly all their staging.

`usd-core` is pip-installable and was considered seriously. Rejected: it imposes a 3D stage model,
`Prim`/`Xform` hierarchies and a substantial learning curve on a fundamentally 2D problem. The ideas
transfer; the library does not.

### Visual semiotics — Kress & van Leeuwen, *Reading Images*

Mostly concerned with meaning and interpretation, which is out of scope. But one part is objective
and immediately usable: **vectors** — the lines of sight and action along which a viewer's eye
travels.

Taken: gaze is a real geometric quantity, so it becomes a term in the balloon cost function.
Balloons are drawn toward the gaze direction and penalised for blocking it. The left-to-right
"given to new" reading also serves as a tiebreaker when a script does not specify staging order. The
rest — ideal/real verticality, modality — belongs to the deferred style layer.

### Cassowary constraint solving

Used via [`kiwisolver`](https://kiwisolver.readthedocs.io/). The value is **not** the arithmetic:
scale and rule-of-thirds placement are trivial to compute directly. The value is the
required/strong/weak **priority system**, which resolves conflicts between competing placement
preferences automatically. The alternative is an ever-growing cascade of hand-written special cases.

### Comic script format and Fountain

[Fountain](https://fountain.io/) · [screenplay-tools](https://github.com/wildwinter/screenplay-tools)

Checked and confirmed: Fountain has **no** native panel, caption or SFX support, and there is no
standardised comic script format at all. But the informal industry convention (`PAGE ONE`,
`PANEL 1`, description, `CAPTION`, character cue, `SFX`) is stable across publishers, and
`screenplay-tools` provides a working tokenizer to extend.

Planned as the human-facing frontend in phase 5 — better than inventing a syntax, because writers
already write this one.

### MPEG-4 FBA feature *groups* — and only the groups

[Overview (PDF)](https://visagetechnologies.com/uploads/2012/08/MPEG-4FBAOverview.pdf)

The ISO standard defines 66 facial animation parameters over dozens of feature points. That is a
measurement, not a notation, and adopting it wholesale would put more machinery in the language than
a drawn face has detail.

Taken: the **grouping** — brow, eye, iris, nose, mouth, jaw — which is about six named features and
is the right size for this. `docs/reference/asset_contract.md` records the mapping from Scenet's
feature names to MediaPipe landmark indices, which is what would make a real face convertible into a
Scenet expression later without importing 478 points now.

Not taken: the jaw group. The head is a circle that does not deform, so a jaw would have no geometry
to move.

### Barrett et al. 2019 — why the expression names are not an emotion claim

["Emotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial
Movements"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6640856/), *Psychological Science in the Public
Interest*.

Recorded here so that a claim this project made in an early draft is never reintroduced. The first
proposal justified Ekman's six as "cross-culturally documented, universal". **That justification does
not survive the literature.** Barrett and colleagues conclude that a specific emotion cannot reliably
be read off a face, and land a methodological hit besides: Ekman's agreement rates came from a forced
choice among six supplied words, and participants given no word list label the "correct" emotion less
than half the time.

It does not sink the feature, because Scenet runs the other way. Barrett's critique is about
*inferring* emotion from a real face. Scenet *synthesises* a drawn face from a declared name, and
comic faces are conventional signs rather than photographs of felt emotion. So the honest framing,
which is also the stronger one for this project:

> These names are a **drawing convention** — the small closed set of faces comics actually draw. They
> are not a claim that a person feeling anger produces this face.

That keeps the notation at the objectifiable level and leaves interpretation to another layer, which
is the thesis of the whole compiler.

### Shape grammars — CGA, as a formalism rather than a library

[Mueller, Wonka, Haegler, Ulmer & Van Gool, *Procedural Modeling of
Buildings*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1141911.1141931) (SIGGRAPH 2006) ·
Stiny & Gips, shape grammars

This entry was under **Future** and called shape grammars "genuinely right for procedural
backgrounds and props". That held, and the setting layer is where it came due. What changed is the
finding that made it cheap:

> **There is no open-source Python implementation of CGA shape grammar.** The reference
> implementation is commercial, inside Esri CityEngine, whose Python integration shells out to a
> separate `.cga` interpreter.

So this is not "add a dependency". It is reusing the **rule formalism** — split, repeat,
subdivide — directly, against a well-documented design: a skyline is a repeat of bays with a split
choosing each height, a treeline is a repeat of canopies, a railing is a repeat of posts under one
rail. A page of code, not a research project. Recorded here so nobody later goes looking for a
library that does not exist.

One discipline came with it and is worth stating: **how many** of a thing there are is derived from
the geometry — a wider span gets more bays — and only **how big** each one is comes from the seed.
Random counts make a backdrop flicker between panels that ought to look related.

### Notan, and aerial perspective

[Notan](https://mitchalbala.com/the-wisdom-of-notan/) · Arthur Wesley Dow, *Composition* (1899) ·
[Aerial perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_perspective) ·
[Layered silhouette depth](https://www.foxrenderfarm.com/share/silhouette-animation-guide/)

Three ideas that between them make a backdrop expressible without a vanishing point, which matters
because this compiler is deliberately orthographic and drawn architecture would fight its own model.

**Notan** — the Japanese light/dark mass principle, which reached Western art teaching through Dow —
holds that place is read from the *arrangement of masses* rather than from rendered detail. Taken
literally: value comes from the plane and from nothing else, so masses at one distance read as one
mass. **Layered silhouette depth** supplies the arrangement, foreground near-black and each
receding plane paler.

**Aerial perspective** is the one that earns its place in a compiler rather than in a style guide,
because it is *parametric*: with distance, value contrast drops toward the atmosphere. Two numbers
per time of day — the value of the foreground and the value of the atmosphere — and the planes are
spaced between them. Monotonic in depth by construction rather than by tuning. That is notation.

The spacing is done in [OKLab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) lightness, because evenly
spaced greys are perceptually uneven. **No colour library was added**: the ladder is a handful of
neutral values fixed once, computed during development and hardcoded, and for a neutral grey OKLab
reduces to the cube root of the linear value anyway. Putting a package through the licence gate to
produce numbers that never change would be the wrong trade.

### COCO-Stuff — the mass vocabulary

[Caesar, Uijlings & Ferrari, *COCO-Stuff: Thing and Stuff Classes in
Context*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03716) (CVPR 2018) ·
[label list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightrome/cocostuff/master/labels.txt)

The canonical taxonomy of **stuff**: "amorphous background regions" as opposed to *things* with a
well-defined shape. Its own argument is that stuff classes explain scene type and the geometric
properties of a scene, which is exactly the job a backdrop vocabulary has. Same reasoning as taking
the predicates from Visual Genome and the caption kinds from Blambot: a vocabulary somebody else
has already argued about beats one invented here.

Taken at the **supercategory** level, not the leaf level. The real classes are `building-other`,
`sky-other`, `wall-brick`, `water-other`; the `-other` suffix is COCO-Stuff's marker for the
catch-all inside a supercategory, and `building-other` is not a word anyone should have to type.

A caveat for anyone extending this: **the supercategory hierarchy is not a file in the repository.**
[nightrome/cocostuff](https://github.com/nightrome/cocostuff) ships `labels.txt` and `labels.md`
only, and the groupings have to be read off the hierarchy figure in the paper. The twelve used here
were each confirmed against the label list by the presence of their `-other` leaf. `textile`, `food`
and `rawmaterial` exist too and are left out: drapery and objects, not scene-defining masses.

Two happy accidents. COCO-Stuff carries `clouds` and `fog` as first-class stuff, so `weather` needed
no vocabulary invented for it either; and its indoor/outdoor split gives the interior/exterior
distinction for free.

### Lettering convention — Blambot, and Balloon Tales

[Comic Book Grammar & Tradition](https://blambot.com/pages/comic-book-grammar-tradition) ·
[Floating text and captions](https://balloontales.com/floating-text-captions/)

Blambot is a letterer's reference rather than an academic one, which is exactly why it is
load-bearing here: it records what the craft actually does. Two things were taken from it directly.

The **caption vocabulary** is theirs — `locale`, `monologue`, `spoken`, `editorial` — including the
finding that "narration", the obvious guess and this project's first proposal, is not one of them.
Same reasoning as taking the predicates from Visual Genome: a vocabulary practitioners already share
beats one invented here.

The **quotation rule for a run of spoken captions** — an opening mark on each, a closing mark only
on the last — is theirs too. It is objective, which makes it testable, which is why it is enforced
by the compiler rather than left to the author.

Balloon Tales supplies the placement principles for floating text: keep off the important figures,
preserve the space the art establishes, keep the reading order flowing. All three were already
implemented for balloons, which is the argument for captions going through the same solver rather
than a parallel one.

### Mort Walker, *The Lexicon of Comicana* (1980)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lexicon_of_Comicana) ·
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/lexicon-of-comicana)

Walker's catalogue of the marks comics draw around characters and objects, grown out of his 1964
National Cartoonists Society piece "Let's Get Down to Grawlixes" and since reprinted by New York
Review Comics. It is written tongue-in-cheek, but the terms entered real use, appear in dictionaries
and are taught in art schools — comics-native, closed and citable, the same three properties that
made Comic Chat the source for faces and Blambot the source for captions.

Taken: **the `marks` vocabulary**. `plewds` (flying sweat), `squeans` (starbursts and circles for
dizziness or drink), `grawlixes` (symbols standing in for an oath) and `briffits` (the dust cloud of a
hasty exit), with *emanata*, his general term, naming the module and the Core field that draw them.

Strictly, Walker's word for the whole family of swearing symbols is *maladicta*, and within it
grawlixes are the squiggles, jarns the spirals, nittles the bursting stars and quimps the astrological
signs. "Grawlix" has since come to mean the whole set, which is the sense the mark is named in; what
it draws is a jarn, a nittle, a bolt and a hash.

Not taken, yet: the rest of the Lexicon — agitrons, solrads, waftaroms and the others. Most attach to
objects rather than to a character's state, and the language has no objects.

### Pages — Cohn's reading-order experiments, and CSS Grid as notation

[Cohn, *Navigating Comics*](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00186) (*Frontiers in
Psychology*, 2013) ·
[Cohn & Campbell, *Navigating Comics II*](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/navigating-comics-ii-constraints-on-the-reading-order-of-comic-pa/)
(*Applied Cognitive Psychology*, 2015) ·
[Peeters, four conceptions of the page](https://imagetextjournal.com/four-conceptions-of-the-page/) ·
Groensteen, *Système de la bande dessinée* (1999)

Reading order is a hard rule for balloons, so a page needed a version of it. Cohn's experiments
supply the evidence. Readers follow the left-to-right, top-to-bottom Z-path on a grid, and depart
from it when a layout does: a tall panel beside stacked ones sends most of them *down* before
across, and overlap, separation and staggering pull them off it too, the more so the further the
layout strays from a grid.

Taken: **tiers.** A page of tiers is read tier by tier and left to right, so the order panels are
written in is the order they are read in, by construction rather than by checking.

Taken: **columns, where they block.** Cohn measured how strongly each departure from the grid
pulls readers off the Z-path. *Blockage*, a tall panel to the right of a stack, sent 91% of
choices down the stack first; *staggering*, rows or columns offset so the gutters do not line up,
left 90% on the Z-path. A tier of columns is therefore read down each column, and two stacks
side by side, which have nothing blocking the way across, are refused rather than read in an
order most readers would not take. *Overlap* split readers about evenly, which is why an inset
will have to say where it is read rather than leave it to be guessed.

Taken as notation: **CSS Grid's `fr` tracks and `gap`.** A tier's height and a panel's width are
shares of what the margin and gutters leave, which is the same model and one people already know.
It is plain arithmetic, so Cassowary has nothing to do here: its value in this project is settling
conflicting preferences, and a strict grid has none.

Taken as vocabulary and as a scope line: Peeters' four uses of the page (conventional, decorative,
rhetorical, productive) and Groensteen's *multiframe*. A tier grid is the conventional use, and
weighted shares reach the rhetorical one, where panel size follows the story's beats.

Gutters narrower within a tier than between tiers, and a lettering size near eight points on a
printed page, follow common print practice; type on a page is set from one height for every panel,
as a letterer sets it.

## Future

### L-systems

The other half of the rule-rewriting family, and still unused. Where CGA subdivides a shape, an
L-system grows a string, which suits branching structure — a tree drawn as a tree rather than as a
canopy silhouette, foliage with individual limbs. Nothing in the current backdrop needs it: masses
are read as values, and a mass has no branches. It becomes interesting if props ever want to be
drawn rather than massed.

## Examined and not reusable

| Source | Why not |
|---|---|
| **[CBML](https://dcl.luddy.indiana.edu/cbml/)** (TEI) | A scholarly XML vocabulary for *encoding existing* comics for analysis, not for generating them. It has no spatial semantics whatsoever. Its terminology is worth borrowing; its schema is not. |
| **Graphviz / DOT** | Useful only as a debug dump of the scene graph. Graph layout optimises for edge crossings and hierarchy, which has nothing to do with pictorial composition. A dead end as a layout engine. |
| **POV-Ray SDL** | A CSG raytracer scene language. Historically interesting as an early declarative scene description, but nothing transfers. |
| **D3.js** | A DOM data-binding library rather than a layout engine, and this project is Python. Its underlying idea is already covered by Vega-Lite. |
| **[MediaPipe Face Landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker)** | 478 3-D landmarks. A *detection output*, not a notation: 478 points is a measurement of a face, and a drawn face has nothing like that much detail to place. Its landmark indices are useful as a **mapping target**, and are recorded as one in the asset contract. |
| **ARKit / MediaPipe blendshapes** | 52 continuous coefficients that "loosely correspond to FACS Action Units". Continuous blending is the wrong model for comics, which use a small set of conventionalised glyphs rather than interpolations between them. |
| **[FACS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/facial-action-coding-system)** | Codes anatomical muscle actions for *observation*, is continuous, and is documented as weak on the lower face. Wrong direction, wrong granularity. |
| **A-star pathfinding for balloon tails** | Frequently suggested, and wrong. A tail is a short tapered stroke from balloon rim to mouth; grid-based A-star produces jagged paths that look nothing like drawn tails. A straight tail with a collision test, bending to a single-control-point Bézier only when obstructed, is both simpler and better. |
| **Physically based sky models — [Preetham](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/311535.311545) and [Hosek-Wilkie](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/projects/SkylightModelling/)** | The obvious neighbours for `time`, and the wrong tool. They solve a *radiometric* problem — spectral radiance over a hemisphere, parameterised by turbidity and solar elevation — which this compiler does not have. Scenet produces a small number of flat tonal values for a drawn comic panel; it is not simulating scattering. The parametric rule it actually needs is aerial perspective, which is two numbers per hour and is recorded above as load-bearing. Adopting a sky model would import a physical simulation to answer a question about ink. |
| **`coloraide` / `colour-science` at runtime** | Genuinely good libraries, and the OKLab ladder was worth computing with one — *during development*. Shipping it would put a package through `.github/allowed-licenses.txt` to recompute a handful of neutral greys that never change. The values are hardcoded with the lightnesses they came from written beside them. |

### Imperative scene programs — Gumin et al. 2025

[*Imperative vs. Declarative Programming Paradigms for Open-Universe Scene
Generation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05482) — Gumin, Han, Yoo, Ganeshan, Jones, Aguina-Kang,
Morris & Ritchie, arXiv 2504.05482

Recorded because it is the strongest published argument *against* the shape Scenet has, and
because it was first proposed for this file — in
[#11](https://github.com/creatoan/scenet/issues/11) — as evidence for the opposite of what it
found. The paper does not show that models do better emitting declarative constraints. It
challenges that consensus: instead of a model stating constraints for a separate solver, the model
writes a step-by-step program that places each object relative to those already placed, and an
LLM-free pass then repairs collisions by adjusting the program's parameters. In forced-choice
studies, participants preferred its layouts to those of two declarative systems 82% and 94% of
the time.

Scenet stays declarative for reasons specific to its domain, not as a rebuttal of the paper:

- **Even the imperative programs contain no absolute coordinates.** Every placement is relative
  to something already placed. Whatever the paper argues, it is not that a model should emit
  coordinates — which is the proposal this entry exists to answer.
- **A panel's hard requirements bind the whole cast at once.** No balloon over any face, figures
  ordered left to right, a shot framed in head-heights for everyone in it: placed one figure at a
  time, the third cannot move the first two to make room. The staging solver resolves them
  together, by priority.
- **The problems differ in size.** The paper targets complex, varied, highly structured 3D
  arrangements of many objects — exactly what it says is hard to express declaratively. A panel
  holds a handful of figures and boxes.
- **Determinism is a requirement here**, and a solver over a stated system gives the same answer
  every time.

What does transfer is the repair loop. The paper corrects the generated program mechanically,
without asking the model again; Scenet's counterpart is
[structured diagnostics](../reference/cli.md#scenet-check) — a finding with a rule, a location and
a fix, applied by the model or a person. Both start from the same observation: generated output is
easy to get nearly right and hard to get exactly right, so the checking has to be mechanical.
