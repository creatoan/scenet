# Asset contract

What a character must declare for the compiler to place it.

## The central rule

**The solver never sees artwork.** It sees only a geometric contract. Everything the layout engine
needs — how tall the figure is, where its mouth is, which region a balloon must not cover, which way
it is looking — is declared as data. Rendering consumes the same contract afterwards.

This is what keeps rendering swappable: the same panel can be emitted as debug wireframes, as vector
puppets, or eventually as hand-drawn artwork, with byte-identical layout in every case.

## Skeletal puppets

A character is a skeleton plus parametric limbs, not a picture. A **pose** is a named set of joint
angles, so `pointing` is data rather than a drawing — which avoids the combinatorial explosion of
one image per pose per expression per facing direction.

A complete puppet, cut down to one arm so it fits on a screen. It loads as it stands, and a test
keeps it that way; the shipped characters in `src/scenet/assets/library/` are the full-size
versions.

```yaml
name: sketch
units_per_head: 100

landmarks:          # vertical offsets from head_top -- the crop lines
  head_top: 0
  eyes: 40
  chin: 100
  shoulders: 130
  chest: 200
  waist: 330
  mid_thigh: 470
  knees: 560
  feet: 750         # 7.5 heads, standard adult proportion

joints:             # a tree rooted at root; each offset is from the parent
  root:       {parent: null, offset: [0, 0]}
  spine:      {parent: root, offset: [0, -130]}
  neck:       {parent: spine, offset: [0, -68]}
  head:       {parent: neck, offset: [0, -82]}
  shoulder_l: {parent: neck, offset: [-34, 6]}
  elbow_l:    {parent: shoulder_l, offset: [0, 95]}
  wrist_l:    {parent: elbow_l, offset: [0, 88]}

parts:              # what is drawn: a capsule between two joints, or a blob at one
  - {from: neck, to: root, width: 72}
  - {from: shoulder_l, to: elbow_l, width: 26}
  - {from: elbow_l, to: wrist_l, width: 22}
  - {at: head, radius: 50}

anchors:            # named points the solver addresses -- a tail ends at mouth
  head_top: {joint: head, offset: [0, -50]}
  eyes:     {joint: head, offset: [0, -10]}
  mouth:    {joint: head, offset: [0, 25]}
  feet:     {joint: root, offset: [0, 420]}

face:
  joint: head
  radius: 65                # balloons may never overlap this circle
  features:                 # what is drawn inside it; paired features come in pairs
    brow_l: {offset: [-20, -27], size: 12}
    brow_r: {offset: [20, -27], size: 12}
    eye_l:  {offset: [-20, -12], size: 9}
    eye_r:  {offset: [20, -12], size: 9}
    mouth:  {offset: [0, 25], size: 16}

gaze:
  origin: eyes              # a declared anchor; the direction comes from staging

poses:                      # joint angles, in degrees
  standing_neutral: {elbow_l: -5}
  pointing: {elbow_l: -80, wrist_l: -10}

expressions:
  neutral: {}
  angry: {brow: angled_in, eyes: narrowed, mouth: frown}
```

A part's keys say which kind it is: `from` and `to` make a bone, `at` makes a blob. A part is
checked only as the kind it is written as, and one that uses the keys of both kinds, or of
neither, is a single error saying so.

## Faces

An **expression** is to features what a pose is to joints: a named record the panel selects by name.
A face *deforms* rather than rotating about bones, which is why an expression is a set of states and
not a set of angles — a nose joint would swing a nose.

### Feature points

`face.features` declares where things are. Each entry is an
[`AnchorSpec`](#skeletal-puppets)-shaped `{joint, offset, size}`, resolved through exactly the same
forward kinematics, mirroring and scaling that anchors get.

They live under `face` rather than in `anchors` deliberately. **Anchors are how the solver addresses
anatomy** — a balloon tail terminates at `mouth` and the solver never learns how a head is drawn.
Features are artwork. Putting drawing landmarks into the one namespace that is supposed to be free of
them would erode the rule the whole tier exists to enforce.

| Feature | `size` means |
|---|---|
| `brow_l`, `brow_r` | Half-width of the eyebrow |
| `eye_l`, `eye_r` | Radius of the eye |
| `nose` | Length of the nose |
| `mouth` | Half-width of the mouth |

Features are optional, individually — a stylised character genuinely may have no eyebrows — but the
paired ones must come in pairs, because a face with one eyebrow is a typo far more often than it is a
character.

**Pupils are derived, not declared.** They are offset inside the eye along the direction of whatever
the character is `looking_at`, so authoring them would mean authoring something the compiler already
knows.

### The names come from MPEG-4's groups, not its point set

The feature names follow the **groups** of the MPEG-4 FBA facial definition parameters. The standard
itself defines 66 displacements over dozens of points, which is a measurement rather than a notation;
the grouping is the reusable part, and it lands at about the right size for a drawn face. The mapping
below is what buys convertibility later without importing 478 landmarks into the language now:

| Scenet feature | MPEG-4 FDP group | MediaPipe Face Mesh landmarks (approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| `brow_l` / `brow_r` | 4 (eyebrows) | 70, 63, 105 / 300, 293, 334 |
| `eye_l` / `eye_r` | 3 (eyes) | 33, 133, 159, 145 / 263, 362, 386, 374 |
| pupil (derived) | 3 (iris) | 468 / 473 |
| `nose` | 9 (nose) | 1, 2, 98, 327 |
| `mouth` | 8 (lips) | 61, 291, 13, 14 |

There is **no jaw group**, which MPEG-4 has. The head is a circle that does not deform, so a jaw
would have no geometry to move. Saying so is better than leaving a group silently missing.

### The expression vocabulary is a drawing convention

```yaml
expressions:
  neutral:  {}
  happy:    {mouth: smile}
  angry:    {brow: angled_in, eyes: narrowed, mouth: frown}
```

Each state comes from a closed set — `brow` from `neutral | raised | lowered | angled_in |
angled_out`, `eyes` from `open | wide | narrowed | half | closed`, `mouth` from `neutral | flat |
smile | grin | frown | open | small`. A state on the wrong feature is an error, not a line quietly
ignored.

The ten names the shipped puppets declare are **Comic Chat's emotion wheel plus `surprise`**:
`neutral`, `happy`, `laughing`, `coy`, `bored`, `scared`, `sad`, `angry`, `shouting`, `surprise`.

They are a **drawing convention** — the small closed set of faces comics actually draw. They are
not a claim that a person feeling anger produces this face, and the docs must never make one; see
[prior art](../explanation/prior_art.md) for the literature that rules it out.

### Level of detail

Below a threshold face radius, no features are drawn at all. At a wide framing a head is a couple of
dozen panel units across, and five features inside it stop being a face and become a smudge — which
is why a cartoonist leaves them out too. `scripts/contact_sheet.py` renders every expression at every
shot type onto one page, which is the only way to decide where that threshold belongs.

## Emanata

Marks drawn **around** a character — plewds, squeans, grawlixes, briffits; see
[the language reference](language.md#marks). A puppet declares nothing for them. Each is placed from
three things every puppet already exposes: the face circle, the facing direction, and the `feet`
landmark. So hand-drawn artwork meets this part of the contract for free.

They are drawn with the same two primitives as a face — sampled strokes and discs — and, like a face,
resolved to numbers in Panel Core so the emitter makes no decision. What differs is where they sit:
**outside** the face circle, which is what makes them the solver's business. Each mark therefore
also yields a **zone**, a padded convex polygon around everything it draws, and the zone is all the
solver ever sees of it.

| Mark | Placed |
|---|---|
| `plewds` | Three drops just past the face circle — two off the back of the head, one off the front |
| `squeans` | Five symbols in an arc over the head |
| `grawlixes` | Four symbols in an arc over the head |
| `briffits` | Puffs on the ground behind the figure, and two trailing strokes |

Zones are **not** in the hull. The hull is what staging spaces characters by and what the camera
fits; a character who starts sweating must not stand further from everyone else. Zones are a
separate soft cost instead — see [design decisions](../explanation/design_decisions.md).

### Level of detail

Two thresholds on the face radius. At or above `MIN_EMANATA_DETAIL`, marks are drawn in full. Below
it, each symbol collapses to a filled dot where it would have been — a plewd at `long_shot` is a dot
— except briffit puffs, which are already as simple as a puff of dust gets, and their trailing
strokes, which are dropped. Below the face's own threshold nothing is drawn: a character too small to
have a face is too small to be sweating. `scripts/contact_sheet.py --marks` renders every mark across
the shot ladder, which is where the first threshold was set.

## Derived at compile time

Forward kinematics resolves the skeleton into, per actor:

| Output | Used by |
|---|---|
| World position of every joint | Rendering |
| `mouth` anchor | Balloon tail termination |
| Face exclusion circle | Balloon placement (infinite cost) |
| Gaze vector | Balloon placement bias, `looking_at` resolution |
| Gaze *aim* | Pupil direction. Computed after placement, since it needs both actors |
| Face marks | Rendering only. The solver never sees them |
| Emanata | Rendering |
| Emanata zones | Balloon and caption placement (soft cost). Never staging, never the camera |
| Bounding polygon (hull) | Occlusion cost, inter-actor spacing |

Face marks are **not** in the hull. The head blob already is, and the features sit inside it, so a
drawn face pushing balloons further away would be a bug rather than a refinement.

`facing` mirrors the puppet about its root X axis; anchors and the gaze vector mirror with it.

## Landmark requirements

Every landmark named in [the shot table](shot_types.md) must be present and monotonically increasing
from `head_top` to `feet`. A puppet missing a landmark cannot be framed with the shot type that
crops there, and validation rejects it rather than guessing.
