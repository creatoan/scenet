"""Drawn faces: feature points, expressions, and where the pupils look.

The tests that matter here are the ones a type checker cannot stand in for. That every
expression produces *some* marks is nearly free; that the ten of them produce ten
**different** faces is the property that decides whether the vocabulary means anything,
and it is the one that would quietly rot if two states were given the same offsets.

What no test can settle is whether a furrowed brow reads as anger on the page. That is
what `scripts/contact_sheet.py` is for.
