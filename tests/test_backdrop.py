"""Resolving a setting into numeric masses, tones and atmosphere.

Two things are testable here and one is not. Testable: that the value ladder is
monotonic in depth at every time of day, that planes land in the right painter's order
around the cast, and that the same source produces the same polygons in a fresh
interpreter. Not testable: whether three greys read as depth. That is a question about
a picture, and `scripts/setting_sheet.py` is the instrument for it.
