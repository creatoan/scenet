/**
 * Monaco language definition for Scenet comic scripts.
 *
 * Comic script is a format writers already use, and its structure is carried entirely
 * by line shape: a heading is a word and a number, a speaker cue is a name in capitals
 * on its own line, a directive starts with `@`, and everything else is prose. A Monarch
 * tokenizer -- which is a state machine over regular expressions, line by line -- fits
 * that exactly, and needs no parser.
 *
 * The one rule worth stating twice, because it is the one that trips people up: a
 * speaker cue is recognised by **the name** being in capitals, not the whole line.
 * `BOB (whisper)` is a cue; the parenthetical is lower case and does not disqualify it.
 * The compiler's own frontend makes the same distinction, and got it wrong first.
 */
