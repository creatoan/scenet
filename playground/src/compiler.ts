/**
 * The bridge to the compiler.
 *
 * There is deliberately no compiler in this file, or anywhere else in this directory.
 *
 * The obvious way to build a browser playground for a DSL is to reimplement the
 * compiler in TypeScript. That forks the geometry into two codebases which then drift
 * apart, and the browser version is always the one that is subtly wrong. Pyodide ships
 * shapely, geos, numpy, pydantic and kiwisolver compiled to WebAssembly, so the actual
 * Python compiler runs unmodified and this file only moves strings across the boundary.
 *
 * The wheel installed here is the exact artefact `uv build` produces. Not a copy of the
 * source, not a browser-specific build -- the same file that goes to PyPI.
